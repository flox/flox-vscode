[Flox](https://flox.dev) is a virtual environment and package manager all in
one. With Flox you create environments that layer and replace dependencies just
where it matters, making them portable across the full software lifecycle.

`flox-vscode` is a VSCode extension that integrates Flox environments with
VSCode.
